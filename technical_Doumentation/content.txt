          <li><strong>Integer Constants</strong>
          <ul><li>An integer constant is a sequence of digits, with an optional prefix to denote a number base.</li>
          <li>If the sequence of digits is preceded by 0x or 0X (zero x or zero X), then the constant is considered to be hexadecimal (base 16). Hexadecimal values may use the digits from 0 to 9, as well as the letters a to f and A to F. Here are some examples:
            <pre><code>0x2f
0x88
0xAB43
0xAbCd
0x1</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>If the first digit is 0 (zero), and the next character is not ‘x’ or ‘X’, then the constant is considered to be octal (base 8). Octal values may only use the digits from 0 to 7; 8 and 9 are not allowed. Here are some examples:
            <pre><code>057
012
03
0241</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>In all other cases, the sequence of digits is assumed to be decimal (base 10). Decimal values may use the digits from 0 to 9.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Character Constants</strong>
            <ul><li>A character constant is usually a single character enclosed within single quotation marks, such as 'Q'. A character constant is of type int by default.</li>
            <li>Some characters, such as the single quotation mark character itself, cannot be represented using only one character. To represent such characters, there are several “escape sequences” that you can use:
              <pre><code>\\
Backslash character.

\?
Question mark character.

\'
Single quotation mark.

\"
Double quotation mark.

\a
Audible alert.

\b
Backspace character.

\e
&lt;<ESC>&gt; character. (This is a GNU extension.)

\f
Form feed.

\n
Newline character.

\r
Carriage return.

\t
Horizontal tab.

\v
Vertical tab.

\o, \oo, \ooo
Octal number.

\xh, \xhh, \xhhh, …
Hexadecimal number.

To use any of these escape sequences, enclose the sequence in single quotes, and treat it as if it were any other character. For example, the letter m is 'm' and the newline character is '\n'.</code></pre>

          </li>
          <li><strong>Real Number Constants</strong>
            <ul><li>A real number constant is a value that represents a fractional (floating point) number. It consists of a sequence of digits which represents the integer (or “whole”) part of the number, a decimal point, and a sequence of digits which represents the fractional part.

Either the integer part or the fractional part may be omitted, but not both.</li></ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>String Constants</strong>
          <p>A string constant is a sequence of zero or more characters, digits, and escape sequences enclosed within double quotation marks. A string constant is of type “array of characters”. All string constants contain a null termination character (\0) as their last character. Strings are stored as arrays of characters, with no inherent size attribute. The null termination character lets string-processing functions know where the string ends.</p>

<p>Adjacent string constants are concatenated (combined) into one string, with the null termination character added to the end of the final concatenated string.</p>

A string cannot contain double quotation marks, as double quotation marks are used to enclose the string. To include the double quotation mark character in a string, use the \" escape sequence. You can use any of the escape sequences that can be used as character constants in strings. Here are some example of string constants:</div>
          
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="key_heading"></p>
        <p class="key_heading"></p>
