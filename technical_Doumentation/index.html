        <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs. It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development due to its efficiency and flexibility.</p>
        <p class="key_heading">Key Features of C</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Procedural and structured language</li>
          <li>Low-level memory access</li>

        <header>Basic Structure</header>
        <p>Every C program follows a basic structure that includes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Preprocessor Directives</strong> - Include necessary header files</li>
          <li><strong>Main Function</strong> - Entry point of the program</li>
          <li><strong>Variable Declaration</strong> - Declaring variables before using them</li>
          <li><strong>Logic Implementation</strong> - Writing the logic inside functions</li>
          <li><strong>Return Statement</strong> - Returning a value from main() is optional</li>
        </ol>
        <pre>
          <code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  // Preprocessor directive 

int main()  // Main function
{  
printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Printing output
return 0;  // Indicating successful execution
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p><em>*Line 2 - A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.</em></p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Lexical_Elements">
        <header>Lexical Elements</header>
		<p>Lexical elements are the basic building blocks of a C program that make up C source code after preprocessing. These elements are called tokens. There are five types of tokens:<strong> identifiers, keywords, constants, operators, and separators. White space,</strong> sometimes required to separate tokens.</p>
		<div class="lexical">
			<div>
				<p class="key_heading">Identifieres</p>
				<p>Identifiers are sequences of characters used for naming variables, functions, new data types, and preprocessor macros. You can include letters, decimal digits, and the underscore character ‘_’ in identifiers.</p>
				<p>The first character of an identifier cannot be a digit. Lowercase letters and uppercase letters are distinct, such that foo and FOO are two different identifiers.
				  When using GNU extensions, you can also include the dollar sign character ‘$’ in identifiers.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="key_heading">Keywords</p>
        		<p>Keywords are special identifiers reserved for use as part of the programming language itself. You cannot use them for any other purpose.</p>
        		<p>Here is a list of keywords recognized by ANSI C89:</p>
        		<code>auto break case char const continue default do double else enum extern
float for goto if int long register return short signed sizeof static
struct switch typedef union unsigned void volatile while</code>
       			<p>and GNU extensions add these keywords:</p>
        		<code>__FUNCTION__ __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ __alignof __alignof__ __asm
__asm__ __attribute __attribute__ __builtin_offsetof __builtin_va_arg
__complex __complex__ __const __extension__ __func__ __imag __imag__ 
__inline __inline__ __label__ __null __real __real__ 
__restrict __restrict__ __signed __signed__ __thread __typeof
__volatile __volatile__ </code>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p class="key_heading">Constants</p>
				<p>A constant is a literal numeric or character value, such as 5 or 'm'. All constants are of a particular data type; you can use type casting to explicitly specify the type of a constant, or let the compiler use the default type based on the value of the constant.</p>
				<div><p><strong>Integer Constants</strong></p>
					<p>An integer constant is a sequence of digits, with an optional prefix to denote a number base.</p>
					<p>If the sequence of digits is preceded by 0x or 0X (zero x or zero X), then the constant is considered to be hexadecimal (base 16). Hexadecimal values may use the digits from 0 to 9, as well as the letters a to f and A to F. Here are some examples:
						<pre><code>0x2f
0x88
0xAB43
0xAbCd
0x1</code></pre></p>
					<p>If the first digit is 0 (zero), and the next character is not ‘x’ or ‘X’, then the constant is considered to be octal (base 8). Octal values may only use the digits from 0 to 7; 8 and 9 are not allowed. Here are some examples:
						<pre><code>057
012
03
0241</code></pre></p>
			<p>In all other cases, the sequence of digits is assumed to be decimal (base 10). Decimal values may use the digits from 0 to 9.</p>
				</div>

				<div><p><strong>Character Constants</strong></p>
				<p>A character constant is usually a single character enclosed within single quotation marks, such as 'Q'. 
					A character constant is of type int by default.</p>
				<p>Some characters, such as the single quotation mark character itself, cannot be 
					represented using only one character. To represent such characters, there are several “escape sequences” that you can use:<br>
					<code>
\\
Backslash character.<br>
\?
Question mark character.<br>
\'
Single quotation mark.<br>
\"
Double quotation mark <br>
\a
Audible alert.<br>
\b
Backspace character. <br>
\e
&lt;ESC&gt; character. (This is a GNU extension.)<br>
\n
Newline character.<br>
\r
Carriage return. <br>
\t
Horizontal tab.<br>
\v
Vertical tab.<br>
\o, \oo, \ooo
Octal number.<br>
\xh, \xhh, \xhhh, …
Hexadecimal number.<br>
and treat it as if it were any other character. For example, the letter m is 'm'
and the newline character is '\n'.</code></p>
				</div>


				<div><p><strong>Real Number Constants</strong></p>
					<p>A real number constant is a value that represents a fractional 
						(floating point) number. It consists of a sequence of digits which 
						represents the integer (or “whole”) part of the number, a decimal point, 
						and a sequence of digits which represents the fractional part.
						<br>
						Either the integer part or the fractional part may be omitted, but not both.</p>
				</div>

				<div><p><strong>String Constants</strong></p>
					<p>A string constant is a sequence of zero or more characters, digits, 
						and escape sequences enclosed within double quotation marks. 
						A string constant is of type “array of characters”. All string constants contain a 
						null termination character (\0) as their last character. 
						Strings are stored as arrays of characters, with no inherent size attribute. 
						The null termination character lets string-processing functions know where the string ends.</p>
					<p>Adjacent string constants are concatenated (combined) into one string, with the null 
						termination character added to the end of the final concatenated string.</p>
					<p>A string cannot contain double quotation marks, as double quotation marks are 
					used to enclose the string. To include the double quotation mark character in a string, 
					use the \" escape sequence. You can use any of the escape sequences that can be used as 
					character constants in strings. Here are some example of string constants:</p>
					<pre>
<em>/* This is a single string constant. */</em>
<code>"tutti frutti ice cream"</code>
						
<em>/* These string constants will be concatenated, same as above. */</em>
<code>"tutti " "frutti" " ice " "cream"</code>
						
<em>/* This one uses two escape sequences. */</em>
<code>"\"hello, world!\""</code>

<em>If a string is too long to fit on one line, you can use a backslash \ to break it up onto separate lines.</em>					
<code>"Today's special is a pastrami sandwich on rye bread with \
a potato knish and a cherry soda."</code>

<em>Adjacent strings are automatically concatenated, so you can also have string constants span multiple lines by writing them as separate, adjacent, strings. For example:</em>						
<code>"Tomorrow's special is a corned beef sandwich on "
"pumpernickel bread with a kasha knish and seltzer water."
is the same as
						
"Tomorrow's special is a corned beef sandwich on \
pumpernickel bread with a kasha knish and seltzer water."</code>

<em>To insert a newline character into the string, so that when the string is printed it will be printed on two different lines, you can use the newline escape sequence ‘\n’.</em>						
<code>printf ("potato\nknish");
prints
						
potato
knish</code></pre>

          <h3>Integer Types</h3>
          <p>The integer data types range in size from at least 8 bits to at least 32 bits. The C99 standard extends this range to include integer sizes of at least 64 bits. You should use integer types for storing whole number values (and the char data type for storing characters). 
            The sizes and ranges listed for these types are minimums; depending on your computer platform, these sizes and ranges may be larger.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>signed char</code>
            <p>The 8-bit signed char data type can hold integer values in the range of -128 to 127.</p></li>
            <li><code>unsigned char</code>
            <p>The 8-bit unsigned char data type can hold integer values in the range of 0 to 255.<p></li>
            <li><code>char</code>
            <p>Depending on your system, the char data type is defined as having the same range as either the signed char or the unsigned char data type (they are three distinct types, however). By convention, you should use the char data type specifically for storing ASCII characters (such as `m'), including escape sequences (such as `\n').</p></li>
            <li><code>short int</code>
            <p>The 16-bit short int data type can hold integer values in the range of -32,768 to 32,767. You may also refer to this data type as short, signed short int, or signed short.</p></li>
            <li><code>unsigned short int</code>
            <p>The 16-bit unsigned short int data type can hold integer values in the range of 0 to 65,535. You may also refer to this data type as unsigned short.</p></li>
            <li><code>int</code>
            <p>The 32-bit int data type can hold integer values in the range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. You may also refer to this data type as signed int or signed.</p></li>
            <li><code>unsigned int</code>
            <p>The 32-bit unsigned int data type can hold integer values in the range of 0 to 4,294,967,295. You may also refer to this data type simply as unsigned.</p></li>
            <li><code>long int</code>
            <p>The 32-bit long int data type can hold integer values in the range of at least -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. (Depending on your system, this data type might be 64-bit, in which case its range is identical to that of the long long int data type.) You may also refer to this data type as long, signed long int, or signed long.</p></li>
            <li><code>unsigned long int</code>
            <p>The 32-bit unsigned long int data type can hold integer values in the range of at least 0 to 4,294,967,295. (Depending on your system, this data type might be 64-bit, in which case its range is identical to that of the unsigned long long int data type.) You may also refer to this data type as unsigned long.</p></li>
            <li><code>long long int</code>
            <p>The 64-bit long long int data type can hold integer values in the range of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. You may also refer to this data type as long long, signed long long int or signed long long. This type is not part of C89, but is both part of C99 and a GNU C extension.</p></li>
            <li><code>unsigned long long int</code>
            <p>The 64-bit unsigned long long int data type can hold integer values in the range of at least 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. You may also refer to this data type as unsigned long long. This type is not part of C89, but is both part of C99 and a GNU C extension.<p></li>

          <p>There are three data types that represent fractional numbers. While the sizes and 
            ranges of these types are consistent across most computer systems in use today, 
            historically the sizes of these types varied from system to system. 
            As such, the minimum and maximum values are stored in macro definitions 
            in the library header file float.h. In this section, we include the names of 
            the macro definitions in place of their possible values; check your system’s float.h for specific numbers.</p>
